Title:
COVID-19 Spatial Agent-based Modeling: Single Room Infection

Abstract:
Several models exist for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) based on varying assumptions and parameters. The Chu and Chen models investigate coronavirus transmission and infection as functions of nonpharmaceutical interventions (physical distances, masks) and respiratory droplets, respectively. The results of the Chu model suggest guidelines for social distancing (1 meter or more) between individuals and public usage of facial and eye protection, while the Chen model shows the relationship between droplet size and transmission range. The two models both attempt to examine coronavirus transmission, but they report results that are not necessarily conflicting, but rather, incomplete on their own. The significance of this problem is that because models vary depending on the parameters and underlying assumptions, there is uncertainty on how to filter out the valid and optimal inputs. In this replication study, we develop a simple infection rate model based on the results and parameters reported by the Chu and Chen models, the MIT COVID-19 Indoor Safety Tool, and the airborne.cam tool by Cambridge.
The output of this experiment will be primarily a simulation where a user will be able to set parameters to see the resulting risks and infections caused by in person instructions. This report will be a secondary output along with the website and visual presentation and will be used as a guide to explain methods as well as theory behind the work.
